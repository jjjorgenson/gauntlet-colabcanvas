# CollabCanvas MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Build a real-time collaborative canvas (Figma-like) where multiple users can simultaneously create, move, and manipulate shapes while seeing each other's cursors and presence in real-time.

**Deadline:** Tuesday (24 hours from start)

---

## User Stories

### Primary User: Designer/Collaborator
- **As a designer**, I want to create basic shapes (rectangles, circles, text) on a canvas so I can build visual layouts
- **As a designer**, I want to pan and zoom around the canvas so I can navigate a large workspace
- **As a designer**, I want to move and resize objects so I can arrange my design
- **As a collaborator**, I want to see other users' cursors with their names so I know where they're working
- **As a collaborator**, I want to see changes from other users instantly so we can work together in real-time
- **As a user**, I want to know who else is online so I understand who I'm collaborating with
- **As a user**, I want my work to persist when I refresh or leave so I don't lose progress

### Secondary User: New User
- **As a new user**, I want to authenticate with a name/account so I can be identified in the collaborative space
- **As a new user**, I want to access the app via a public URL so I can start collaborating immediately

- Direct canvas manipulation

**Cons:**
- Need to implement drag-and-drop, hit detection, transforms yourself
- More time for basic features
- More complex for MVP timeline

---

#### Option 3: React + Fabric.js
**Pros:**
- Rich feature set for canvas manipulation
- Built-in object model
- Good for complex shapes

**Cons:**
- Heavier than Konva
- Some performance issues at scale
- More features than needed for MVP

---

### Phase 2 (AI Agent) Considerations

#### Option 1: Firebase - MODERATE Difficulty
**AI Integration Path:**
- Use Firebase Cloud Functions to call OpenAI API
- Store API keys securely in Firebase Config
- AI commands trigger Cloud Functions which manipulate Firestore

**Pros for AI Phase:**
- Secure API key storage (not exposed to client)
- Cloud Functions can call OpenAI function calling API
- AI-generated changes automatically sync via existing Firestore listeners

**Cons for AI Phase:**
- Cloud Functions have cold start delays (2-3 seconds first call)
- Limited control over request/response streaming
- Some reported reliability issues with OpenAI calls from Cloud Functions
- Need to manage function timeouts (default 60s, max 540s)

**Complexity:** Medium - straightforward integration but some performance trade-offs

---

#### Option 2: Supabase - EASIEST (Recommended for Full Project)
**AI Integration Path:**
- Use Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime) to call OpenAI API
- Or create a separate Node.js API service alongside Supabase
- AI changes written to PostgreSQL trigger real-time subscriptions

**Pros for AI Phase:**
- Edge Functions are faster than Firebase Cloud Functions
- Better for streaming responses (if needed later)
- PostgreSQL transactions useful for complex multi-step AI operations
- Can batch AI operations atomically
- Modern Deno runtime with TypeScript support

**Cons for AI Phase:**
- Edge Functions are newer, less documentation than Firebase
- May still want separate API service for complex AI logic

**Complexity:** Low-Medium - clean separation of concerns, good performance

---

#### Option 3: Custom WebSocket Server - MOST FLEXIBLE
**AI Integration Path:**
- Add OpenAI API calls directly in your Node.js backend
- AI commands processed in same server as real-time sync
- Full control over execution flow and optimizations

**Pros for AI Phase:**
- Complete control over AI request handling
- Can optimize for streaming, batching, caching
- No cold starts or timeout issues
- Can implement sophisticated planning/execution logic
- Easiest to debug AI behavior

**Cons for AI Phase:**
- More initial backend work (but pays off in Phase 2)
- Need to manage deployment complexity
- More code to maintain

**Complexity:** Low (if backend already built) - most natural integration

---

### Recommended Stack Based on Full Project

**For Fastest MVP + Easiest AI Extension:**
**Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time + Edge Functions)  
**Frontend:** React + Konva.js  
**AI Integration:** Supabase Edge Functions â†’ OpenAI API  
**Deployment:** Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend + DB)

**Reasoning:** 
- Supabase gives you 80% of Firebase's ease of setup
- Edge Functions are better suited for AI API calls than Cloud Functions
- PostgreSQL transactions help with complex AI operations
- Clean architecture that scales into Phase 2
- All in one platform for simplicity

---

### Alternative: Custom Backend (If You Have More Time)

**Backend:** Node.js + Express + Socket.io + Redis  
**Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB  
**Frontend:** React + Konva.js  
**AI Integration:** Direct OpenAI API calls in Express routes  
**Deployment:** Railway/Render (backend) + Vercel (frontend)

**Reasoning:**
- Most flexibility for AI agent implementation
- No vendor lock-in
- Best performance potential
- But requires more upfront investment (worth it if you're comfortable with backend)

---

## Out of Scope for MVP

### Explicitly NOT included:
- AI Canvas Agent (Phase 2)
- Text layers with advanced formatting
- Rotation, advanced transforms
- Multi-select (shift-click, drag-to-select)
- Layer management and z-ordering
- Delete, duplicate, undo/redo
- Advanced color pickers or style panels
- Export/save functionality
- Real-time chat or comments
- Permissions or access control
- Advanced conflict resolution (use last-write-wins)

---

## Critical Success Factors

### The MVP Must Demonstrate:
1. **Solid multiplayer foundation** - Two users can see each other and their changes
2. **Smooth performance** - No lag, stuttering, or FPS drops during basic operations
3. **State persistence** - Canvas survives page refresh
4. **Deployed and accessible** - Working URL that anyone can visit

### Test Scenario (Self-Check):
1. Open app in two different browsers
2. Authenticate with different names
3. See both cursors moving in real-time
4. Create a shape in Browser 1 â†’ appears in Browser 2 instantly
5. Move a shape in Browser 2 â†’ updates in Browser 1 instantly
6. Refresh Browser 1 â†’ canvas state restored, shapes still there
7. Both users can continue editing without issues

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
1. **Real-time sync complexity** - Start with cursor sync first (simplest), then object sync
2. **State conflicts** - Use last-write-wins for MVP (document this choice)
3. **Performance under load** - Test with 3-5 users early, throttle updates if needed
4. **Time management** - Cut scope aggressively if running behind. Working multiplayer > more features

### Fallback Plan:
If real-time sync is failing at hour 16:
- Simplify to "refresh to see changes" model
- Focus on state persistence
- Document limitations
- Ensure deploy works
